In this folder are:

	3 screenshots of dashboard UI design that I created by following dashboard wireframes. These show my ability to execute on design requirements elegantly
	(now that I look back at it, there's some clear button redundancy with the "submit changes" button, but other than that everything looks pretty good to me)

	A pdf which contains:
	
		Context for the design theme
		
		UI requirements from my team member who did the wireframes
		
		My suggestions to changes to the wireframes and design (labeled with "SUGGESTION:"). These are the places where I show my aptitude for simplifying designs
